# Negative-Number-In-Binary-Representation:
3 ways to represent negative numbers:
1) sign magnitude representation
2) 1's complement
3) 2's complement

1) Sign magnitude : 
 In this form the MSB is used to represent the sign bit and remaning bits are used to represent magnitude.
 for n bits we can represent numbers in range -(2^(n-1)-1) to (2^(n-1)-1)
 suppose for 4 bit number 2^4=16 so we can store 0-15 values for unsigned numbers but in sign magnitude we can have range as -2^3-1 to 2^3-1 
 3) in 2's complement range in -(2^(n-1)) to (2^(n-1)-1)
